Hey guys, sorry I'm not here today

To run this,

1) load the unpacked extension into chrome (hit Reload every time you make a code change)

2) Go to a page like xkcd.com (only a few images to make it easy and fast)

3) It will take around 10 seconds but the tab will pop up an alert

The idea is that the only work left is in the content script to take the state data
and calculate the difference in total size. Better to just do that in Dart.

Background.js requires Dan' URL pattern to be inserted at the TODO



Overview of what I did:

I discovered we had to do all our webrequest listening
in background.js, not the contentscript.

Part I is it finishes listening for the requests
Part II is it does the Ajax requests to JpegMini to find out the sizes

Finally the state is two objects that is sent to the contentscript
for calculation and display to the user
